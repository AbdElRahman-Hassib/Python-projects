->num1,num2,num3 =int( input("Enter 3 numbers separated by spaces").split())

->print("""Here you can type " or ' as you like """) 

->x,y,z = 1,2,3        -> In python you can assign multiple variable at the same line and this is useful in swapping

->assert x==1 , Error  -> Here if the condition is true nothing will happen,else the print will be performed

->for variable_name in range(end) or (start ,end ) or (start,end,step)

->for item in  (enumerate(range(5,8))) -> here the item is a tuple that contains 2 values the index (0,1,2) and the value (5,6,7)

->If we have a global variable and we want to assign this variable in a specific funtion we HAVE TO use global keyword as shown :global variable_name 
because if we have globale and local variable ,thepriority is to use the local one
 
->In python we have keyword argument feature which is after definine a function with for example 5 default paramenters , 
we can initialize only the 3rd parameter by typing it's name = initial value
Ex: def func(a=1,b=2,c=3):
calling -> func(c=5) and here we don't have to respect order here
